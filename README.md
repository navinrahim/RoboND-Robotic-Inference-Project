# RoboND-Robotic-Inference-Project
Use Deep learning for object classification using NVIDIA Digits platform

---

## Prerequisite 
- NVIDIA Digits has to be installed for running this project. Digits is available in the Udacity Workspace.

## File structure
- Writeup of this project is present [here](./Robotic_Inference_Project.pdf)
- Trained model for vegetable classification is present in the model folder

## Introduction
This repository discusses the implementation of two image classification tasks. First one involves identifying bottles, candy boxes or nothing from images taken over a conveyor belt and the second one involves identifying onion, garlic or nothing from images taken over a table.

## Dataset
- The conveyor dataset is provided by Udacity. 
- The vegetable dataset can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TQIdBObaWiwhSi2l2AewfntHm5Qate3D).

## Results
More about results can be found in the [writeup](./Robotic_Inference_Project.pdf).
